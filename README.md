VISU Application
==========



Installation
-------------
1. Cloning the repo and running the app

``` git clone https://github.com/coin-quin/vis-a-vis.git -b dockerized```

``` sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.kari .```  (See Kari's notes below)

``` sudo docker-compose up```

The server is now running and can be accessed at localhost:8082, but no data is loaded on it yet. Three services are started by Docker: **web** (the web app, port 8082), **mongo** (the Mongo DB, port 27017), and **mongo-express** (the DB management dashboard, port 8081). NB: A *debugger* is attached to the web service on port 5858.

Usage 
------------

1. Loading data source (Kactus2 logs) from outside the container

``` cd datasources/log/```

``` sudo npm install```

``` node collector2.js```

Use file *log.txt* as input in the last command. This data can be visualized with the User Timeframe or Session Timeline visualizations.

2. Loading data source (issue data) from within the web app

Go to Collectors/API collector. Select the API and enter the parameters. This data can be visualized with the other visualizations.


Kari's notes
------------

I have "hacked" docker-compose.yml not to run "nmp install" since it seems to fail with the combination of pre-historical version of node and current state of library hub.
Unfortunately, Hugo's original base image does not work out of the box. That's why "Kari's image" need to be created. At the moment you need to

``` sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.kari .```

In next version proper image will be in Docker-hub.
